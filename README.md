## 🐧 Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

https://github.com/allisonhorst/penguins

This repository contains my *DataCamp* project *“Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species”*. The goal is to apply unsupervised clustering techniques on penguin morphological data to uncover groups (species) from patterns in the features.

## 📄 Project Overview

Researchers collected measurements on penguins in Antarctica, but the species labels were omitted. Using the provided dataset (`penguins.csv`), the task is to:

- Explore and preprocess the data  
- Scale features appropriately  
- Use clustering (e.g. K‑Means) to partition the data into groups  
- Visualize cluster assignments and interpret the results  

The dataset includes the following variables:  
- `culmen_length_mm` — culmen length  
- `culmen_depth_mm` — culmen depth  
- `flipper_length_mm` — flipper length  
- `body_mass_g` — body mass  
- `sex` — the penguin’s sex (used as a categorical variable)
