## 🐧 Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

![Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/penguins)

This repository contains my *DataCamp* project *“Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species”*. The goal is to apply unsupervised clustering techniques on penguin morphological data to uncover groups (species) from patterns in the features.

## 📄 Project Overview

Researchers collected measurements on penguins in Antarctica, but the species labels were omitted. Using the provided dataset (`penguins.csv`), the task is to:

- Explore and preprocess the data  
- Scale features appropriately  
- Use clustering (e.g. K‑Means) to partition the data into groups  
- Visualize cluster assignments and interpret the results  

The dataset includes the following variables:  
- `culmen_length_mm` — culmen length  
- `culmen_depth_mm` — culmen depth  
- `flipper_length_mm` — flipper length  
- `body_mass_g` — body mass  
- `sex` — the penguin’s sex (used as a categorical variable)
- 
1. *Load & examine data* — check for missing or strange values  
2. *Encode categorical variables* (e.g. `sex`) as one‑hot or integer dummies  
3. *Feature scaling* using `StandardScaler`  
4. *Elbow / inertia method* — try different values of *k* (number of clusters), plot inertia to select a plausible *k*  
5. *Fit K‑Means* with chosen *k*  
6. *Assign cluster labels* and inspect cluster centroids  
7. *Visualization*:
   - Scatter plot in 2D projections colored by cluster label  
   - Plot of centroids  
   - Compare cluster means across features  
8. *Interpretation & insights* — how well do the clusters align with expected species groupings?

📈 Sample Visuals & Results

*(Embed or link here to a few example plots, for instance: inertia curve, cluster scatter, centroid overlay. You can place images in `outputs/plots/` and link them.)*

- Inertia vs. *k* plot  
- Clustered scatter of first two principal components or raw features  
- Centroid markers superimposed on cluster plot  
- Table summarizing average feature values per cluster

🏁 Key Findings & Discussion

- The *elbow plot* suggests that *k = 3* or *k = 4* may be reasonable choices  
- Clusters group observations that are similar in morphological traits (e.g., body mass, flipper length)
